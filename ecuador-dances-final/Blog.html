"The responsibility is the most important thing for a person who has the command of a group. The reason is because if the head is not responsible, the members never will be. It is very difficult as there are situations in which sometimes we can not solve and make everyone get along. There are also situations where you have to deal all the time but there are unforgettable moments. We also share something is common. We share art, passion, feelings, strength and a thousand things that are going on our bodies. It is said that the union of a group gives us a lot of strength. There are hard days and beautiful days. There're also days that there's money and also days that there's nothing. I do not care whether there are bad days. All I care about is about sharing what I am passionate about with the group. Also, sharing it to the audience when we dance together. I know that our big boss in heaven is really proud of us and he knows that each presentation we do it for him as well.

I have met people that have become very important in my life. I've also visited places that I never expected to visit. When dancing, I feel full of joy and pride because I can show how beautiful the Ecuadorian culture is to the public. Being away from my home country has been a rough journey, but when I dance, it reminds me of where I come from and I very close to my home place.</p>

Dance taught me the importance of hard work and dedication. It taught me how to be truly and completely dedicated to something. 
We learn discipline, punctuality, people skills because you work in groups and other people rely on you. </p>
